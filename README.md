# lil-box

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cag/lil-box.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cag/lil-box)

A little Truffle box.

* No frontend. Choose your own frontend adventure, or forgo it altogether!
* Designed to work with NPM and Git out of the box.
* Comes with its own Truffle.
* Gives you a `truffle-local.js` to hide things in.
* Has robot maintainers.

Sounds good? Get it with:

    truffle unbox cag/lil-box
